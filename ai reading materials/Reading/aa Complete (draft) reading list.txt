Complete (draft) reading list
Hello students, 

Please find below an approximate collection of readings gathered from the AI course.

We are providing this list as it was requested in a webinar. We extracted all the references from readings and PDF slides for the course, so they have some varied formatting. The list does contain some repetitions. We have not fully formatted this yet as we wanted to release it as soon as we could. Later we will re-visit this list and format it properly. We hope you find it useful, even in this draft state.

You do not need to read all of these articles -  this is simply a list of all readings found in the course, including ones we simply used to extract quotes.
